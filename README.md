I am making this program to run on a CMS interface. Its intended purpose is to run a series of AJAX calls (but I don't want to be limited to AJAX) which call server-side code to handle large data transfers from one server to another. My other goals include the ability to tell the user interface how far along the transfer is by means of callbacks and the ability to cancel anything remaining in the queue if necessarily.
